👋 Hi, i’m **Sergio**, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for programming.

❤️ I love **programming** and **cybersecurity**, everything I know I **learned on my own**, and it is something I am proud of, as I have developed a great **ability** to learn new things every day.

💤 I learned to program one day when I was 10 years old **because I was bored**, from then on, I developed a **great passion** for cybersecurity and I usually program in my free time for **FreeBSD**, **Debian** and **Nmap Project** or on my **personal projects**.

🇪🇸 I'm live in Spain
